# Hello!

This is my first post. I haven't yet started the *fastai* course, but my goals for the course are:
1. To become familiar with PyTorch and fastai software.
2. To train models that achieve state-of-the-art results in computer vision
3. To improve my knowledge regarding deep learning techniques
4. To become more employable to deep learning companies
