# Lesson 2!

Lesson 2 gave some handy tips for training models and also went through an example of using Gradio + HuggingFaceSpaces to set up a user interface.

Some interesting takeaways:
-Training a before *before* cleaning the data is useful because training the data helps you identify what exact features the model is struggling with
-Good data augmentation functions: randomresizedcrop(), aug_transforms()

-fastai provides a much easier way to plot the confusion matrix than what I used in q2 of the assignment (with fastai it can be done in just 2 lines)

-For manual cleaning you can use ImageClassifierCleaner(learn). This is cool, but if the dataset is large this probably wouldn't be very useful since it is manual.

-You can save your model using learn.export('test.pkl') and load it using load_learner('test.pkl'). This is very useful because it saves you from having to re-train the model each time!
