# Lesson 1 Complete!

Lesson 1 offered a demonstration on using fastai to create a CNN model to distinguish between birds and forests. After the lesson, I then extended this example to create a model that can classify 10 different types of animals. I appreciated the DuckDuckGo Image Search API because it means you can create your own categories and search for images on the web. This is easier than sourcing a labelled dataset that may or may not have the exact categories you want. However, an issue with searching for lots of images from the web is that not all of them may be suitable. For example, one of my elephant images was an elephant ornament on a lamp! The model was still able to achieve high accuracy and was easily visualised with a confusion matrix.

Some other takeaways from lesson 1:
- Importance of learning PyTorch as TensorFlow is becoming less and less popular
- Fastai is built on top of PyTorch
- DataBlock offers an easy way to get your data into a model
- Resnet18 is a popular pre-trained model
- You don't need to finetune tabular data
